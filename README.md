# COREY TRANCHITA

I am taking this course for career puproses. My plan is to go into front end web-development and possibly become a fullstack developer once I get really good at the front end of things. I also plan to use this course to possibly do freelance work in the future, making basic websites for people just for some extra cash on the side.
