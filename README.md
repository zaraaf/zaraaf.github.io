# COREY TRANCHITA

I am taking this course for career puproses. My plan is to go into front end web-development and possibly become a fullstack developer once I get really good at the front end of things. I also plan to use this course to possibly do freelance work in the future, making basic websites for people just for some extra cash on the side.

During assignment 2, I learned that the fundamentals of javascript are VERY VERY similar to other languages that I have learned (Visual Basic, Python). Not only is it similar but I find that the syntax is much more forgiving than say, Python. I plan to use this in education and the real world when I'm learning other languages. I can fall back on my fundamental experience with JavaScript and learn the language just a bit faster.

During assignment 2, I learned that functions are used to keep code organized. I also learned how to use math objects and how they make the math so much easier to do and comprehend. I can use this in the real world to make sure my code looks nice and to make the math portion of my code a lot easier.
