I am taking this course for career puproses. My plan is to go into front end web-development and possibly become a fullstack developer once I get really good at the front end of things. I also plan to use this course to possibly do freelance work in the future, making basic websites for people just for some extra cash on the side.

During assignment 2, I learned that the fundamentals of javascript are VERY VERY similar to other languages that I have learned (Visual Basic, Python). Not only is it similar but I find that the syntax is much more forgiving than say, Python. I plan to use this in education and the real world when I'm learning other languages. I can fall back on my fundamental experience with JavaScript and learn the language just a bit faster.

During assignment 3, I learned that functions are used to keep code organized. I also learned how to use math objects and how they make the math so much easier to do and comprehend. I can use this in the real world to make sure my code looks nice and to make the math portion of my code a lot easier. 

During assignment 4, I learned how to use JS events. This is very useful to get certain information when something is clicked or typed instead of a prompt loading in the moment the webpage is loaded. This is great for UX and makes the website work a lot smoother. I plan to use this in the real world to make sure the UX of my websites are good.

During assignment 5, I learned how to use if statements and case statements. This is very useful because if statements are used in almost EVERY single program that is made that has logic. This also opens up an avenue for making failsafes to make sure that something that you dont want to happen wont happen. I plan to use this in the real world when making almost any code that has logic that needs to be done.

During assignment 6, I learned how to use while loops. This is very useful because it simplifies code and allows you to loop through logic until you get a desired output. This is amazing for when you want to loop through something more than once and you dont want your code to be just a jumbled mess. i.e (x + x = 1 x+x = 2 x+x = 3 x+x = 4) instead of writing all that out you can simplify it using a while loop. I will use this in the real world to simplify code.

During assignment 7, I learned how to make use of for loops and the syntax for them. This is very useful because it allows you to loop through a predetermined amount instead of while loops which loop when you dont know how many times you are going to loop. This is great for when you have a predetermined amount that you are looping through. I can use this in the real world for when I need to loop through code that I already know how many times i want to loop through it (10 times, 20 times, etc).

During assignment 8, I learned how to make use of arrays. This is very useful because it allows you to store multiple entries into an array to be later picked out or used in a logic statement. I will use this in the real world when making any kind of menu that can be interacted with or when using multiple buttons that add something to an order section of a website.
